# ducky-scripts

Scripts I've written for the rubberducky.

For now the only script is `bootstrap_raspberry.py`, which enables headless initialization of Raspberry Pis. This makes the Raspberry forward local ssh through a ssh tunnel to an existing host that you can use to drop right into fun mode, without needing a keyboard or monitor for configuration.Automatically expands the root partition for you.
